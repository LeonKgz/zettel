# Society and State dichotomy

- Anarchists make a clear distinction between Society and State. Society being a sum of voluntary associations and State being a body to maintain a particular compulsory legal order. 

- Anarchists argue that the State is a recent development in human social and political organisation and that humans have managed to organize themselves meaningfully, peacefully and productively in a natural way without the State. Without the artificial coercions of the State the naural harmony of interests among human beings will emerge.
  
 - When asked with a question: "Who would replace government?" numerous anarchists answered:  "What do you replace cancer with?"
