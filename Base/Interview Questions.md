### What made you think to apply to [input company]

	I have experience of working in both a start-up and a larger company and I prefer the former, since working in a smaller team allows me to take responsibility over larger and more crucial portions of a project. This is the kind of productive work I enjoy.

Dear Sir/Madam!

I am a Comuting gradute from the Imperial College London. 


### 
 - Introduction
	I am a recent Graduate 

- What sort of jobs you are looking for
    Experience: Python and Java would be my strongest kanguages as of yet. I have decent experience 
	working with HTML/CSS and Javascript as well.

 - Eventually sponsor a # Skilled Worker visa

# Please describe what your final year project is or will be based on and the reason why you have chosen this topic area?



We are looking for graduates with the following characteristics:

### Methodical approach to problem solving

### Ability to use your initiative to undertake tasks efficiently and independently.

I was able to take the initiative on a couple of personal projects which included

### Excellent verbal communication skills, which allow you to confidently liaise with clients and team members.

### Excellent written communication and attention to detail, and be able to demonstrate accurate technical drawings and good report writing.



Methodical Approach to Problem Solving





# Please demonstrate how your skills and experience are relevant to the role you have applied to (4000 character limit):


Just submit something based on the first cover letter. 

-   Building Information Modelling
-   GIS
-   CAD
-   Databases
-   CodingÂ 
-   Application Development

I have had a great deal of experience developing all sorts of application in both university group/personal projects and during my 2 internships. 

I have had a great deal of experience coding from working on group and personal projects at university developing various applications to two paid internships in the last 2 years. During my summer 2019 internship at Brightsign I was working on developing a mobile application to communicate with a specialized glove that converts sign-language gestures into text. In addition to that I set up a serverless backend with Firebase Functions to store user data. As the need arose I also built a website in Angluar that handled user registration and subscription through Stripe API. On top of that I was introduced to various Agile Methodologies such as maintaining a product backlog, daily Scrum stand-up meetings and CI/CD.

During my 2020 6-month placement at Schlumberger I joined the Omega Infrastructure team at the heart of the development and the release process of the Omega system, a comprehensive processing environment for geophysics to allow for processing and visualizing seismic acquisition data. On top of my daily duties such as maintenance of CI/CD (Jenkins), creating reports in Power BI (JavaScript, SQL) and bug fixes (Python, Java) I got to work on larger personal projects as well. One of them involved developing an onload parser (Python) for the admin documentation page (based on hyperlinks within the documentation pages) that generated a tree structure and displayed it through an HTML table. Another required me to set up logging (JavaScript) with Google Dashboards platform to monitor server performance through respective Google metrics and alert users about anomalies.

# Final Year Project
The main focus of my final year project was to look into ways to apply different Reinforcement Learning techniques for effective resource management of IoT devices to maximize energy efficiency of LoRaWAN protocol for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) with a focus on Nonorthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) signal
decoding technique. An open source Python framework was used to simulate the relevant network environment and train learning agents. 

A thorough study of deep reinforcement learning approaches to the resource allocation problem of LoRa networks with NOMA was conducted. In particular temporal difference algorithms such as Q-learning and SARSA were compared and extensive hypertuning for deep Q-learning was executed. The best performing deep Q-learning approach proved to perform better than the existing static setting allocation and the ADR algorithm
proposed by LoRa Alliance.

Relative performance was evaluated on the basis of throughput and energy ratio metric. Further inspection of other metrics such as Data Extraction Rate and parameters such as payload size and channel variance showed that the proposed algorithm can compete with the existing approaches as well.

The main reason I have chosen this as my final year project was my interest in the field of Reinforcement Machine Learning as it was one of my ealry motivations for studying Computer Science in university. The news of the infamous AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol match in 2016 sparked my interest in the field and encouraged me to pursue this career in the first place.

# *Please demonstrate how your skills and experience are relevant to the role you have applied to (4000 character limit):

I have had a great deal of experience coding from working on group and personal projects at university developing various applications to two paid internships in the last 2 years. I believe that various languages, technologies and methodologies (mentioned above) that I have practised make me a candidate suit for the job and match at least 3 items from the job specification: Databases, Coding and Application Development. 


# *Please explain your motivation for applying for this position. (4000 character limit):

I am interested in this programme because I want to make an impact early in my career and explore as many career opportunities in the field as possible. I believe the graduate scheme will allow for that flexibility and provide helpful insights through mentorship which can be so important for someone with as little experience in the industry. I am excited to get a hands-on experience and put my knowledge into practice.

# If you join us as a graduate, you will have the opportunity to get involved in a wide variety of group initiatives. Based on your interests what areas would you like to get involved in outside of your role and why? (4000 character limit): 

 - Charity as I have had experience volunteering for the GDG 2018 Fest
 - I have had experience tutoring Computing to student bla bla so I would be interested in joing STEM outreach programme as a natural progressions of that 


I would be interested in participating in the STEM outreach initiative as I have had experience tutoring school students when I joined the Pimlico Tutoring Group to help tutor A-level Physics to a group of students aged 16 to 18 weekly in 2019/20. I also home tutored GCSE Computer Science to a student aged 14 through the Imperial Tutors Service. 

I would also be interested in sports days initiatives as I held the post of Imperal College Kendo Club Vice President in the 2020/21 academic year and also enjoy participating and helping run sport events.

# Why Work at Amadeus
I am excited to join an inclusive multinational environment that I am used to, throughout my time in United Kingdom in Sherborne Internation College, Cardiff Sixth Form College and Imperial College London.

I was born in Kyrghyzstan, grew up in Russia and was accustomed to travel since the young age, thanks to my parents. They took me to a multitude of countries and I have been in close contact with the travel industry for as long as I can remember myself.

Developing complex systems, working with newest technoilogies and have a real time impact on travel industry.

A flexible work-life balance, potentially remote work opportunitiy?

Dynamic Company? Don't want to get stuck in a routine 
It's important for me to work in a dynamic environment that doesn't allow me to spiral into a routine. 

I think one of the responsibilities that I would be willing to  take on is to encourage more people to explore rural areas  in their own counries and around the globe, support local businesses and thus favour more market competition regardless of the industry, be it catering, hotels/inns, schooling, farming, or even tech. 

I am willing to develop my leadership and managerial skills as I do have the will but lack real experience and mentorship. I did attempt to somewhat undertake a role of Scrum Master during a university third year group project.
