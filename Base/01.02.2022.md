# Create Logs for different types of operations on discord server for accountability
 
 can put all logs in an embed of sorts
 check for char limit though is over the limit maybe display the last logs that fit into embed.
 
  for actors and plays add points through add points command just supplyting all the necessary info such as description type of addition etcetera 
 
 ## Becoming an Actor
 ## Participating in a play
 ## Potentially for participating in Manas as well?
 maybe add that later as its only happened once or twice and hasnt lifted off since
 record data but dont publicize yet
 
 
 ## Earning weekly activity points on server
  - fill up logs base
  - enable logging when recording activity (automate logging for that)
  - 
 ## Writing a telling that is approved eventually 
  - automate logging for that too
 
 
 ## Updating one's description
  - automate logging for that too, whenever the description is marked by a moderator
  - only when descriptino is marked by ALL moderators (same time when its posted in гласность)
 
 ## ???
 
 1. Populate the logs with previous info
 	- First for all actors but the two/three latest ones with the same timestamp  


maybe accumulate points for new desccriptions so that people have incentive to update their description every week to earn more points. if somebody submits the same description or very similar one than it is marked as 0 or near 0 depending on how much the original was amended.

but then I'd have to save old descriptions of users as well...


 - add google transslate option and borgoise channel specifically for english bot interactions
