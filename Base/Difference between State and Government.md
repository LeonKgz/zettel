# Difference between State and Government

Within a given territory State remains while governments come and go.
The government is that body within the State which claims legitimate authority to make laws. It also directs and controls the State apparatus.

Tucker defined State as a "monopoly of a government" in a particular area, and government as an"invasion of  the inidividual's private sphere"
