# Chuudan no Kamae (+Suriashi)

## Legs
Legs must be parallel to each other, and you don't always need to look at them to check. Left heel is raised and there is tension in the leg. 

## Body
Body is upright, keep the tension in groi area and make sure the centre of body mass is no too high, so that you can't comfortably move around with suriashi. 

## Back
Keep tension in lower back area, the bum is slightly up, so you ARE NOT pushing it in, slightly sticking it out (this is waht allows the back of hakama to be higher). 

Standing upright, don't slouch.

## Head 
Always keep head to the ceiling without pushing too far back. Keep eyes up, at about eyebrow level.  

## Arms
Hands are not gripping shinai too tightly, in a way relaxed, so you should not feel tension in your palms. All the tension is directed to your tricep/shoulder/back muscles. This allows one to keep Chuudan no Kamae for a long time.
