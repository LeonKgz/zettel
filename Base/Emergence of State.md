# Emergence of State

The State did not appear until about 5500 years ago in Egypt. Most of the world's population continued to live in clans and tribes. Their conduct was regulated by customs and taboos; they had no laws, political administration, courts or police to maintain order or cohesion.

Kropotkin in his study of the origins of the State argues that the Roman Empire was a State, but that the Greek cities and the medieval city republics were not. In European nations, he argues, the State barely dates from the sixtienth century when it took over the free towns and their federations. It resulted from a "Triple Alliance" of lords, lawyers and priests who dominated society. They were later joined by capitalists who continued to strengthen and centralize the State and crush free initiative. The common people in the meantime were persuaded to co-operate with the process and grew accustomed to voluntary servitude.
