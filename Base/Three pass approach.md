# The three pass approach
- ##### First pass (~15 minutes)
   1) Сarefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
   2) Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
   3) Read the conclusions
   4) Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read
- ##### Second pass (~1 hour)
   1) In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs.
   2) Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
   3) Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading
- ##### Third pass (~4-5 hours)
    1) Attempt to virtually re-implement the paper
	2) Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
- ##### Literature Survey 
    1) Use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer to find three to five recent papers in the area.
    2) Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Identify the top conferences in that field
    3) Go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will identify recent high-quality related work.
