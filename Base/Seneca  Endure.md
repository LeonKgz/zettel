# Seneca  Endure

Winter brings on cold weather; and we must shiver. Summer returns, with its heat; and we must sweat. Unreasonable weather upsets the health; and we must fall ill. In certain places we may meet with wild beasts, or with men who are more destructive than any beasts ... And we cannot change this order of things ... it is to this law [of Nature] that our souls must adjust themselves, this they should follow, this they should obey... That which you cannot reform, it is best to endure.
