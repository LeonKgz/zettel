-   When doing men nuki do, turn your hips in the direction of movement, i.e. diagonally. Also do the fumikomi not to the side but diagonally as well.  
      
    When doing small men RELAX shoulders. Open your chest. Focus on fumikomi ashi rather than hitting with your arms  
      
    When doing small men keep your pelvis and upper body vertical and straight  
    Relax shoulders  
    Lift arms  
    Dont stifen up  
    Extra hard back leg work to reach further  
      
    Today I am gonna focus on correct aiming before hitting  
    Especially aim to hit with correct part of shinai when hitting men, do, kote  
      
    When doing fumikomi or suriashi focus on keeping your posture, keeping center of mass low and explosive back foot  
    covering huge distances COVER AS MUCH AS YOU CAN YOUR MAX STRETCH  
 
    Remember your best "men" try or whatever and focus on that.  
    Dont think too much during jigeiko  
    Apply that. Let your body remember the whole technique from start to proper zanshin finish.  
      
    Dont block mindlessly. Retreat to chuudan no kamae at all times.  
      
    For your best men it is  
    [ ] Big explosive fumikomi  
    [ ] Dont turn around too quickly, you'll get hit  
    [ ] Straight posture  
    [ ] FOCUS YOUR LOWER BODY  
      
    For kirikaeshi  
    Each hit be precise and accurate, aiming for the head. Dont do too fast. Do it at the pace your kiai allows you.  
      
    When making semei, don't go back and forth. Do a bit of boxing bouncing, keeping shinai alive. Then make semei. Take center! Then hit.  
      
    For jigeiko  
      
    Doesnt matter what your opponent does, you're the one deciding how the attempt will end. Even if you miss still carry out till the end with zanshin  
      
    NEW OBJECTIVE  
      
    Aim and hit properly  
    Focus on the correct arm movement now  
      
    Proper bowing  
    Suriashi smaller after strike  
    When hitting do, do proper furiage  
    Bouncing off when doing suriashi strikes  
      
    Do proper suriashi dont run on the ground, always left foot behind, proper suriashi  
      
    More decisiveness about when ypu decide to hit. Don't wait for your opponent, you are the only one who can decide when you commit and strike.  
      
    By all means dont block as sensei told you.  
      
    With harai, omoi and suriage fpcus on the palm movement and the blade will follow. Use the whole arm from shoulder, focus on timing and significant momentum and power of the slap (払い)  
      
    Today  
      
    Dont rush whzn hitting  
    Concentrate on arm movement aiming for the head each time aiming to win  
    Think of shinai as arm extensions, not as being seperate objects  
      
    Dont lose head in match or when hitting  
    Отдавай себе отчёт в том что делаешь В КАЖДЫЙ МОМЕНТ ПРАКТИКИ  
      
    Fumikomi Dont need to stomp front foot  
    Focus on correct back movement and the right one just follows along  
  
      
    Dont go back and forth, its an easy to identify pattern and people will use it against you. Always keep pressing forward. Keep up the good pressure. The path of no retreat)  
      
    Figure out tjat feeling of aiming and hitting target with left hand control during shiai.  
      
    For small men left hand arches up following the дуга of men  
      
    When hitting small men you hands straighten out in the air prior to strike. Dont fold them in before you strike.  
    Straighten them then hit and you should always see your nakayui during zanshin.  
    The reason your zanshin is too high is because you fold your hands in BEFORE hitting the target. STRAIGHTEN THEM OUT.  
      
    DONT BE SCARED. DONT BACK DOWN. APPLY PRESSURE.  
      
    !------—  
      
    In jigeiko you need to "want to win" more than "not want to lose", because it shows.  
      
    More attention to hitting distance if you wanna start hitting kote in jigeiko.  
      
    Do the same commitment as in kihon.  
    From start to finish you look at your opponent and commit the whole movement. Maybe try before striking nlt taking eyes off the area of hit. Keep eyes on it the whole time. Everytging else is in peripherals  
      
    For big men your
    
-   pushing forwaed to much and applying pressure too low.  
    Focus on throwing you arms more, starting from the back of your shoulder.  
      
    For small men, ask for more advice, how its different.  
      
    Maybe try big men in jigeiko, ask sensei  
      
    The main problem ks that you lose all focus and calm in jigeiko.  
    Need to imagine that you are always in jigeiko during kihon. Get used to that feeling. Dont let your alert down during kihon. Keep it the same. Train under these conditions. Maybe get ised to alertness. Even under alert you do all parts of the hit properly intil zanshin. Aiming all the time eager to hit the opponent and score. Eager to score npt afraid  
      
    03.11.21  
      
    After each strike: if it was bad, think what was wrong and try to fix it  
      
    If it was good, rememeber what you did right and do it again  
      
    Your main centering problem might be with when you are raising shinai for strike. It deflects off of the opponent shinai and loses centre. Make sure you have center xhen starting up motion and I guess do it quickly enough in a xay so that your shinai doesnt interfere with anything and goes straight up!  
      
    Also train each time to increase your hitting distance. Make it at far as possible  
    Try hit kote more often. Its much smaller movement, all about speed.  
    Its actually right there. Just feel the right distance and hit it maybe from under but typically dont need to do that even.  
    Keep eye on it and focus even if its moving. Pull shinai bavk far enough to go to the left. Or play with shinai switch sides for kote strike.  
      
    05.11.21  
      
    No running. Even if tired make sure to do proper suriashi.  
      
    Go through even if you are unhappy with a cut or not sure, in jigeiko go through always  
      
    In kata number 1 - uchidachi moves first (when stepping back 2 times). That is for grading.  
      
    During jigeiko you can commit a few strikes to bring opponent guard down.  
    Kote to men. For kote make sure no ar very small step in and fumikomi also.  
      
    Dont forget to do big men to when you fee lappropriate as it has greater power for now.  
      
    DONT GO BACK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES  
      
    09.11.21  
      
    As you get tired make effort to hold proper kamae and dont curl up.  
      
    When hitting men dont squeeze forward  
    As your arms go down your elbows stop at shoulder hight and only then your arms straighten out forward into a men strike. Otherwise you are hitting mengane with your shinai and fall short, rather than hitting men properly from the top. Squeezing in includes keeping your back straight also during do.  
      
    Debana Kote. Opponent goes for men.  
    You go for kote.  
      
    DONT STEP BACK AND FORTH  
    YOUR OPPONENT WILL FOLLOW THE TIMING AND HIT YOU. WATCH THE RECORDING.  
      
    10.11.21  
      
    Eye level keep above eyev level all the time. Dont lower it.  
      
    Strong and staright lower back. Even if tilt its still straight.  
      
    Fast kote, slow kote doesnt work. Snap fast.  
      
    Keep posture during suriashi ans fumikomi extra practice.  
      
    Going up and down too slow. Snap fumikomi and men and everything.  
      
    11.11.21  
      
    Only move forward on leftvover momentum. If you stop against person infront of you, just stop. Your momentum is finished. Go back to chuudan.  
      
    When chasing dont get too excited or anxious to hit the guy. Concentrate and have centre, aim you ass off! Dont rush to a point your form goes to shit.  
      
    12.11.21  
      
    Its hard to keep cool durimg jigeiko and keep everything in your head. All the stuff goes out of the window.  
      
    Therefore you can only hope for muscle memory and habits from kihon geiko!  
    Do that at kihon when you ARE cool. Make those habits durimg kihon geiko. Make them effortless.  
      
    Train your eyes as well. Dont stare at the target area for too lobg. Keep eyes above eye brows at all times i.e. men nuki do  
      
    During jigeiko there will only be one or two chances when opponent will open for strike (for now think of men).  
      
    Dont miss those chances, watch out for them constantly and when they come just perform a normal strike. Dont rush. Dont hesitate. Go natural.  
      
    Picture perfect kendoka like sensei.  
    Keep their imag
    
-   e in your head.  
    Just imitate them maybe?  
      
    12.11.21  
      
    Good energy, spirit. "Channel it into legs and you will be unstoppable"  
      
    Do jougeburi a lot. And you'll stop thinking about keeping kamae consciously.  
      
    When really tired just go back to kamae and take 2 seconds to get breath back.  
      
    15.11.21  
      
    Dont raise your rams after men strike.  
    Concentrate on that.  
      
    16.11.21  
      
    When getting into hitting distance, dont ever readjust left foot. You lost ai men because Tom was a millisecond faster since he went right for the strike, while you hesitated.  
      
    When hitting men, overextend arms as sensei showed. This will allow to make use of the wrists to reach further with less effort on upper body.  
      
    The moment you see your opponent even before shiai, fight started. All extra thoughts go away. You are in fighting mode even before you do rei. You are already prepared to strike.  
      
    Suburi and meditate before saturday.  
    Covid lateral flow test on the day before.  
      
    02.12.21  
      
    Grabbing too tight because keepibg tension all the time. Only need to grip during instant of tenouchi strike. All the other time, hands (palms) actually relaxed.  
      
    For tsuki make a box punch, go back.  
    Hands extend into nobite, back tension, everything is straight.  
      
    When receiving dont go raise head (men)  
      
    03.12.21  
      
    During swing throw whole arm for good sound. And focus on shoulder muscles.  
    Dont lower left arm too low.  
      
    When standing up, the bum should be up, not pushed in as you normally do.  
      

      
    For harai (omote, uragi) men/kote strikes  
    First the left hand moves then the slap is done with right. Its a one movement strike harai and men/kote during single fumikomi.  
      
    Kote debana omote harai kote (from under)  
      
    Kote debana uragi harai men (from the right)  
      
    Both ONE MOVEMENT.
