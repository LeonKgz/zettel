# How to Read an Engineering Research Paper

-   Highlight important comments as you go. Using a highlighter, as opposed to underlining, can really help key senteneces "pop out" at you when you return to review the paper later.
-   Mark the important paragraphs of the paper according to motivation/problem, idea/solution, their evaluation, and contributions.
-   On the front of the paper, write down the take-away message.
-   On the front of the paper, or near the end, write down your key questions. Other questions may be written in the margins as you read.
-   Try to answer the questions for yourself, as best you can. Use Google or other sources as appropriate.
