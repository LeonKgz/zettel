# Anarchists and Marx

Marx criticised anarchists such as Bakunin and Prouhdon for their views on how a transition from the State to a free society would occur. He believed that there needs to be a transitional period, a "dictatorship of the proletariat", for the reorganisation of production. He, Engels and Lenin argued not for the abolition of the state, but for its «withering away». 

The differences however were not only in tacticts but in the underlying theory as well. Marx based his analysis substantionally on the dialectical materialism, and argued for the primacy of the capitalist economy over State, while anarchists persisted on the State influence over the economy. 

Ananrchists also unlike AMrx did not have a coherent class analysis (in view of Marxists), with vague understanding of the people, whose interests they are representing.
