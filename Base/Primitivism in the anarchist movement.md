# Primitivism in the anarchist movement

Primitivism in classical anarchy takes 2 forms: **chronological** in that the anarchists believe that the best period of history was before establishment of State and **cultural** in that they think that the acquisitions of modern civilisation are evil. Despite that they are still progressive in looking forward to a new era of self-conscious freedom.
