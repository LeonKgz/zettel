# Key to fluid kakari-keiko

In order to be able to do kakari-keiko fluidly you need to have your foot work nailed down. Correct ashi-sabaki and tai-sabaki are the key (foot and body movement). That will help you to make the correct strikes and move fluidly and make it seem smoother overall:

	Men! Men! Kote-Men! Do! Men! Kote! Men-Kote-Men!

rather than:

	Meeen! ... Meeen! ... Koteeee! .... Meeeen!
