I will not be teaching anythign advanced or something they dont need only the stuff sensei taught us obviously

whenever have questions ask sensei

its important that you learn the feeling of doing a technique right and wring 

for many of these its a good idea if you can to do it in front of a mirror

# Kamae
 - back position
 - arms position
 - left foot
 - ceter of mass
 - point of kamae (its the best retreat if you have a good kamae you are well protected and have good statring position for attack)

 - basic foor work bring back foot wuickly
 - be stable ready to launch or move in any direction

tension in the upper body
make sure you dont feel heavy and stuck to the floor
half of the success in kendo is foot work so make sure you work on it, it should be swift and precise

left foot
