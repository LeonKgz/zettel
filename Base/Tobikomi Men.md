# Background

 - One mistake that senseis constatnly point out is that you pull shinai towards yourself, rather than swinging it forwards, this causes you a delay in execution and also potentially missing the target, since you pull with your right hand to the side.
 - when receiving dont push out left foot, so its easier to move to the side. Keep normal kamae, and dont break it

# Kakarite Objectives
 - when going for small Men, move left hand/fist towards opponents tsuki
 - move arms forward and execute Men so as to not drop your left elbow, as Daigo sensei points out
 - keep good posture when hitting men, hikitsukeashi so as to not lose good posture and keep hands in good zanshin
 - right after the hit, "relax" you joints (to be able to do Renzoku Waza)

# Motodachi Objectives
 - keep straight kamae
 - if the opponent is experienced dont just open bluntly and offer some resistance, but not too much. They need to practice [[Seme Ashi]] as well

# Kihon-Geiko

# Uchikomi-Geiko
 - make sure last men is the best men you can do, the most correct one, as this will be the one your body learns (last Men of keiko).
 
# Kakari-Geiko

# Hikitate-Geiko
 - watch out for opportunites that sensei is creating for you, such as stepping for debana waza, or Ai Men.
 - when entering make sure to keep kensen centered and dont lose cetnre easily  and carelessly
