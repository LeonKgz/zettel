# Kote-Men strike

## Legs
First stomp involves no forward mobement of left foot. 
Its a stationary stomp and the second one is proper forwards fumikomi ashi. 

## Timing
The stomps rhythm is basically two consecutive claps. 
Wrist movement therefore is really small to match the rapid timing. Timing is essential.

## Striking impact / Tenouchi
Thus the striking force comes mostly from the tenouchi rather than the swing. The bounce off kote allows shinai to go up into the men strike. 

## Motodachi (for Ai Kote Men practice)
As motodachi just hit kote, dont go through, allow Aite to hit your men and step aside basically as during normal kote hitting practice.
