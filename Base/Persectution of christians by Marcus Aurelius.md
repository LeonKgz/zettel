# Persectution of christians by Marcus Aurelius

11.3 is interesting because of his contrast between the Christian and the Roman approach, as perceived by Marcus: “What a soul is that which is ready to be released from the body at any requisite moment, and be quenched or dissipated or hold together! But the readiness must spring from a man’s inner judgment, and not be the result of mere opposition (as is the case with the Christians). It must be associated with deliberation and dignity and, if others too are to be convinced, with nothing like stage-heroics.”

What the emperor is condemning here is an eagerness to meet death without real justification and without due dignity, as he thought the Christians were doing. “Marcus looked upon the Christians as misguided enthusiasts, who had to be punished as the law then stood, but whom he no more than Hadrian and \[Antoninus\] Pius wished to punish.”
