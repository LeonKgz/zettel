# Anarchists on voting

Anarchists recognize that liberal democracy and representative government cannot be utilized effectively to achieve any meaningful goals. 

- Prouhdon: "Fear of the people is the sickness of all those who belong to authority; the people, for those in power, are the enemy ... **Universal Suffrage is the Counter-Revolution**". Prouhdon insists that the struggle takes place in the economical and not political arena.
- Bakunin: "All political organisation is destined to end in the negation of freedom"

Hence the popular slogans: "Whoever you vote for, the government always gets in", or "If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal".
