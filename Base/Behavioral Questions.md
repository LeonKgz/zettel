[[00 (book) Cracking the Coding Interview]]

# Brightsign Internship
 
 ## Challenges  	
  - The main challenge for me was building the user subscription system through Stripe API as this was first experience developing full stack application and trying to design, develop and test the connections between the website, stripe API, backend and the mobile app was quite challenging for me at first. But through some perserverance and UML?? api call diagrams I managed to break the process down into digestible bits and implement the system.  

 ## Mistakes/Failures
  - One if the issues I had was maintaing the git branches for the repositories that I used and a few times
 
 ## Enjoyed
  - I enjoyed the responsibility and ownership of the software I wroteas I wrote nearly of off the code myself and the senior engineer was mostly reviewing my pull requests and giving his comments 

 ## Leadership
  - I was the only person really working on the code so I am not sure it applies here.  
 
 ## Conflicts
  - again no major conflicts with the company CTO
 
 ## What you'd do differently
  - I think If I could I wouldn't use Angular as it seemed to bulky and unnecessary of an addition for a simple task that we implemented. 
 
# London Bikes
## Challenges
 - The main challenges were related to working with bike service APIs. For example Mobike bikes could only be parked in certain areas of London so we had to account for that when planning the travel route. Limbike API was the hardest since it required SMS verification so we had to use a TWILIO online phone number to retrieve SMS information whenever the API authentication key expired.

## Mistakes/Failures
 - We managed to roll out a functional MVP by the deadline, but backend failed to account for the unreliable 3rd party API failures , and this accumulated into noticable time spend processing the API codes, we could potentially find other more reliable APIs or at least cache some of the information and inform the user of the latest data's relevance at least. 

## Enjoyed
 - I enjoyed trying out new technologies such as working with MongoDB for the first time, JAVA Spiring Framework and also seeing how some SCRUM rituals workout in a team. 

## Leadership
 - I took some project management responsibilities such as ensuring daily meetings and also maintaining Azure DevOps through which we managed our tickets, kanban board, biweekly iterations, git repository and deployment.

## Conflicts
 - There were some debates around which tech to use. For example the team really wanted to go with technologies they already knew, while I pushed for alternatives. so I was the main proponent for the use of Azure DevOps and MongoDB for example while the team just wanted to go with Asana and PostgrSQL for example. I managed to convince them with the fact that Azure could handle a lot of functionality for us while keeping it in one place and making our lives simple, such as tickets, kaban board, iteration logs, deployment, git repository and additional perks such as integrations with SLACKS.

## What would I do differently

 - I think if I could I would attempt at vertical slice type development rather than the horizontal type we did. I think that would work for a small team and this kind of toy project such as ours and also at the end we would have a more functionality versatile product where each member would me able to contribute across the stack rather than the split into 4 backend guys and 2 frontend guys we did. 
    
    In terms of SCRUM rituals some things naturally made sense, such as regular stand ups, and weekly iterations, but I guess I realized that we deidn't really need a rigid system of compulsory daily stand ups and weekly iteration and product backlog reviews because we afterall had other courses and work going on, so some adequate regularity sufficed for our needs. We also tried out some extra security checks available at Azure such as mandatory pull request reviews and merge restrictions. I guess most of the verbal feedback I received was negative as people were used to making quick changes when they needed them quick especially by the deadline.
