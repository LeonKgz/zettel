What I need to do is to first of all as Confucious says start loving studying
learn to study and to train to study without being idel most importantly

Now I need to focu most on the job search
nothing else is importnant right now
so every aspect regarding job search needs to be polished and nailed down

 - algorithms and interview questions
 - interview questions about my past experiences my strengths and weaknesses, etc.
 - couple of frameworks behind my belt to be able to apply for more jobs
   use these frameworks in personal projects 
 
 - pick up on old languages tot expand horizons too, take courses on the ones you already know
  to fill in the gap

allocate for each of these required time of the day and focus on nothing else as much as 
on this

After new year time have a month break from streaming all together to focus on 
job search.
